== Tiny OS ==
Just used for getting back into assembly programming and playing around
with bootstrapping.

== Getting Started ==
You must first install qemu for this to work.  And you must have basic
development tools like make, nasm, objcopy and what not on your PC as well.

# runs the bootstrap with embedded kernel on the second sector

 make clean test

# runs the bootstrap with separate kernel in kernel.asm (not working)

 make clean kernel

== Shifting Kernel Offset ==
If you need to shift the kernel into another sector, because you need more
reserved space between the boot sector and the kernel, you need to follow these
steps.

# adjust the first "mov ax, 0x800" in boot.asm by the number of sectors you're moving the kernel by.  It must be a "shr by 4" amount.  i.e. one sector is not 0x200, it's 0x20 added on to that value.  0x800 would become 0x820 to move it one sector down.
# increase the number of sectors read in the start_kernel section
# adjust Makefile for kernel.bin to dd to the boot.flp at a different offset, e.g. 3 for the 4th sector
# add a multiple of 512 bytes of padding before "stage2" to ensure it's address will be correct.  namely something like "pad times 512 db 0x0ff"

If you fail to update the data segment offset in kernel.asm, the boot loader will fail with an error message about not finding the kernel.
